nfcd plugin
===========

Works with pn54x Android driver which essentially passes raw data
packets back and forth beetween user mode and NCI compatible chip.
The device name can be configured via /etc/nfcd/plugins/pn54x.conf
file like this:

  [Plugin]
  Device=/dev/pn547

The default device is /dev/pn54x

Note that 64-bit driver often needs to be patched to allow calls
from 32-bit nfcd by adding compat_ioctl entry pointing to the same
function as unlocked_ioctl.
